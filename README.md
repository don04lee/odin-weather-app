# Weather Checker

This is my solution following The Odin Project's curriculum. This program is a simple weather app, where Weather API is used to generate the weather conditions of any specific city that is searched by the user. This program utilized HTML, JS, and CSS for the Weather API to be easily accessed by the user.

The main difficulty of this project was identifying the usage of APIs, as this was the first time I've ever used an API. Taking in the data from the JSON file and organizing it into a UI proved to be challenging and allowed me to understand how APIs work a great deal.
